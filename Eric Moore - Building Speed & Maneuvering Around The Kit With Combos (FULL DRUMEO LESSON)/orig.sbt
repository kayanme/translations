00:17:23
00:17:44

So, in my mind what I hear is <> So I am hear that al time.
00:17:43
00:17:44

So, when you hear that going in your head - that how I started. It will be like: "How are you playing so fast". Maybe because I hear that <> <????>
00:18:12
00:18:14

ALl that this is. Accenting on <one-two-three>. But I just hear it. It is not like that I need sixteen notes in order to going is, because at the time I didn't know anything. I didn't know even how to read. I don't know how to read a book. I don't know how to spell Drumeo. But I knew I love drums. So that is all about having this love for this instrument and to build, okay?
00:18:43
00:18:43

Just because you see me or you see any other drummer playing all the fastest chops believe me, I used to see and watch Denis Chambers and the best of all of that my how they playing so phenomenal. One day I get to that and all I had to do was invest the time and energy to get to that. So.
00:19:00
00:19:05

That was a little bit about me. ANd a little bit of my insight. Back to the chops. So, we're building of this. All singles. But I just accenting on a note. And I'm accenting on a  tom. And it gets faster.
00:19:41
00:20:06

So, but it took time, it took years. And years to play and to listen and to be on the know, that I eventually get that your mind has to grow, your ability have to grow, your muscles have to grow. And everything that you do you don't just start off great. It is some people do, thought. I know some don't. Listen drummers, you be like me and now are you playing that, you re only nine years old! <???> The ability of Youtube. Because that what I say if you can hear it - you can play it. So these drummers today, they are hearing me, they are hearing <Runo Bruno>, yes, I know the name of the young ledgins, you know Tony Royster, Tomas Pridgens all these drummers that are amazing - Gordon Campbel <???> - it's so many drummers - Nisan Store <???> - I can name them more, because they are all my friends And I love them and I can take from everything they drumming, it's som many. But because have youtube you have amazing sites drumeo and other sites, that you can get diffenerent things from.You are hearing all this. And if you can hear this -you can play it. So it is all about a progressing with it All about progressing with it.
00:20:43
00:21:06

M: Totally..am.. totally everything you do - you got to start slow. It's just like a relationship like you just don't go to third base, you know, "hey girl, how do you doing let's go home", you know, it's kinda weird. Oh no. You know, you are be dealing with  websites <system> nowadays. Kinda crazy, you know. I raised in church we gotta go'em a long way. To get there you got to go a long way. But.. here you know everything takes time so like I'm just showing you, like that was a single, single phrase, single exercise, that was single exercise. And when you play the singles - you can accent on anyone that you want to don't take it if it as "I have to do it this way", okay? You re listening the music, so you can like "I love you, yeah, I love you, yeah".
00:21:43
00:21:53

And I keep it triple right there. So let's say I do that "I love yous". And I hit the bass drum in a rhytm I do it.
00:22:00
00:22:03

Man,so you take that and you go speed it up. So, let's say we started at 80 bpm.
00:22:04
00:22:09

M: I don't even have a metronome, 'cause I don't want to go onto it, I just wanna show you we're gonna start slow and we go up, okay. You can find your own tempo, don't make me to  the tempo - you decide, where you at. I don't know where you at, because I haven't have the pleasure of meeting you and loving you the way I do, because I love all drummers. So, you have to start that way you start out.
00:22:34
00:22:34

Now we build it up.
00:22:41
00:22:42

We build it up.
00:22:46
00:22:46

Build it up.
00:22:50
00:22:50

Build it up.
00:22:50
00:23:10

And that where the speed startss coming in. And you have take all that, okay, that was just one exercise, you start taking'em singles, and you maneuvering them around the kit. The was the functionality in everything starts from, so you got.
00:23:36
00:23:44

Now, you like "what was that, holdup< what was that", "what did you just do","what was you just are". That is called a ddidles.Okay, you gotta learn how to hit the diddles in there.
00:23:48
00:24:14

<Let me doll> the diddles so play extra two notes. If I append you know,lot, the triplet "it's the triplet", "he's playing the triplet", "oh my god". You know, yes, the triplet it is finesse, because with the triplet you can play so much though. With the triplet you can play the inverted paradiddles, nay, there is so many things you can do, like the double stroke rolls, start of that, so I just playing the single, so. Let's you gonna work on your double stroke rolls.
00:24:36
00:25:38

And that's was.. that's was crazy about this - all of those singles I just played a paradiddle, a single, single stroke rolls, paradiddles and double stroke rolls. They all sound the same. But to some drummers it is like "yo man, you have to show me that <exact stick>, I got to know the difference between a paradiddle and the single stroke roll and it's like "bro, yeah you do? if you are in class and your teacher ask you to come to the drawing board  and show me what you learned this week". But I am not coming to you! I am just wanna hear it when I see you on youtube and <nice> you played that solo I.. I don't...it wasn't...when I heard that record I wasn't like "yo, did you play what denis chembers play ... or did you play ...". What's... it is sound the same, bro, I just hear a different tom, but I used doubles, I just played a paradiddle, so ... I just wanna hear you playing man.
00:25:35
00:25:38

N: yeah-yeah, yeah.
00:25:39
00:25:40

N: so it's no about the sitcking
00:25:40
00:25:41

It's not about the sticking, you can't, you can't let that take over your mind, because if you let that take or influence you too much - you won't be able to play with a band.
00:25:41
00:25:41

N: Yeah.
00:25:41
00:26:05

When it comes time to play that music - like that's why we  drummers-that's all about make all those people dance, making'em feel good. Every gig I have - believe me - it was about making'em feel good. But I love clinics, I can I love clinics, but that's why you know I coming to play fast and  play all the stuff, because, I wanna make be like "oooh" and "aaaahh".
00:26:05
00:26:08

N: That why playing to drummers is to different than play to the other people.
00:26:08
00:26:19

Yeah, it is man, I care. Because you think about it @not everybode is a drummer@ you know, we are special. We think special, we are special, we are amazing creatures and we are drummers.Okay, we are drummers, totally.
00:26:19
00:26:34

N: I bet I greet you to there, but, here we gets the question, that I bet, that we gonna get. What about technic? What did you say about techinc, when somebody ask you "ooh",<you have seen my speed> like finger technic or moeller technic or anything like that. What is your approach to that or what you have to say about.
00:26:34
00:28:59

What I have to say about that is that just like moeller came in - he showed you his way of how did he played it, or how he moved around the kit. How these drummers have this wheeping technics, and how  they get their hands to go like that. You have to to do what is best for you. Okay. I can't tell you how to get that gig, because I don't know, what that gig is calling for in your city or whatever that person <that> you might get that gig is playing for. So. It's just like with drums - I don't know how your arm is made maneuvering when you was a kid. Like when I was a kid I used ride motorcycles, <I was like my dad> I ride motorcycles and I broke my toll. I had to get a cast on my foot for three months, so I could not play my right foot for three months. So I had to play drums with my left foot. So my right foot actually moves different, because of that, that disability I had when I was a kid.And that was crazy, I love you see all this videos of me when I was really-really big, when I  weight 500 pounds - yeah man, good old days- when I a big <ake> I played flat footed, and that's because my leg so big, and I have so much weight on myself, that everything I do was just flatfootin. Now I can move my foot, and I can play with my heel up, and I can play different styles.But I say that to say this: everybody is different. You nay, you may be a big drummer, you may be a small drummer, you may be a skinny drummer = everyone is different. So the moeller technics and everything you just have to figure out what works best for you. You can let it all, definitly I say don't let it all, but everything is different. Try different thigs, I noticed that with me on order to move around the kit I like my kit, I like my toms to be very-very close, so I set up like a different way than everybody else, I know it's a lot drummers that my set a floor toms up, maybe little bit further, snare drum little be and they play with the toms closer. So that how they may like it. For me I like everything be like a certain, a certain way, so it feels comfortable. Everybody's different. I am tall, I am six-three, you know, I'm really tall, I have long leg, so I sit higher, I might sit lower, may fingers are longer than yours - who knows? Everything is different. So about been a drummer you just <can't> focus, you know, a one certain style and one, that why I love so many different drummers and so many different styles, that why I play everything, from <arm repab>,rock,everything, I wannna play it all. Like.. I want a country gig.
00:28:59
00:29:00

N: You want a country gig?
00:29:00
00:29:01

Heck yeah. I wanna play so many different styles of the music like.. that's my goal too.
00:29:01
00:29:02

N: So it's you've been playing sinceyears you we 2.
00:29:02
00:29:03

Yeah.
00:29:03
00:29:04

N: So, did you even remember some of the routines you did or somewhat that the long sessions with the <woodshed> where you just working on your speed. You did?
00:29:04
00:29:05

Yes, I really really do, so like I was saying, with that leak, that was like my first leak, coming into the game, so. So playing that leak, I had to progress it and what I were do was when I added the diddles I would hear like the diddles with it my left hand.
00:29:54
00:31:06

Because at this time a don't know the differ between paradiddles, singles, triples - I don't know none of that, I just hear it. And I wanted an easier way to do it. So, it's that go... I don't have to move this hard. And if the same thing, I want... you don't, but it like...so I can play as it single...you know, <I were really to sit there>. And I would build it like I wanna play a one in. And I would just anna practice... I guess it's like been bored. I here overstayed it, but when you're young you just have a little bit of time.Okay? Drums are amazing, it's the fun instrument! You don't have to be serious, man. It's all about having fun.
00:31:06
00:31:07

N: Totally yeah, man.
00:31:07
00:31:08

It's a rule.
00:31:08
00:31:09

N: So, what about a combos, getting combos into that.
00:31:09
00:31:10

Alright, so yeah, so I just like I just show you - that was the combo! Like that was a combo. That was a combo come in, so when you see the drummer play anylike... So, that was all I.. no, seriously, so...I play inverted doubles, okay. That how I called them inverted doubles. What is that to it very simple.
00:31:10
00:32:22

I <lift> it's like a combo form. Like all my DVD it's all about. I do gig. You feel like you playing a street fighter. You hit there <...> COMBO!!! For real, in a shed, like that's for you to try knock'em out. WHen you comes to with that combo it's like "uuuuuuu". <Winner.> That where combos come in.
