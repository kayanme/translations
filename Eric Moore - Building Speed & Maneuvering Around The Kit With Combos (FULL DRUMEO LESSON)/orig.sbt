So, in my mind what I hear is <> So I am hear that al time.
00:17:43,640
00:00:04

So, when you hear that going in your head - that how I started. It will be like: "How are you playing so fast". Maybe because I hear that <> <????>
00:18:12,622
00:00:04
ALl that this is. Accenting on <one-two-three>. But I just hear it. It is not like that I need sixteen notes in order to going is, because at the time I didn't know anything. I didn't know even how to read. I don't know how to read a book. I don't know how to spell Drumeo. But I knew I love drums. So that is all about having this love for this instrument and to build, okay?
Just because you see me or you see any other drummer playing all the fastest chops believe me, I used to see and watch Denis Chambers and the best of all of that my how they playing so phenomenal. One day I get to that and all I had to do was invest the time and energy to get to that. So.

That was a little bit about me. ANd a little bit of my insight. Back to the chops. So, we're building of this. All singles. But I just accenting on a note. And I'm accenting on a  tom. And it gets faster.

So, but it took time, it took years. And years to play and to listen and to be on the know, that I eventually get that your mind has to grow, your ability have to grow, your muscles have to grow. And everything that you do you don't just start off great. It is some people do, thought. I know some don't. Listen drummers, you be like me and now are you playing that, you re only nine years old! <???> The ability of Youtube. Because that what I say if you can hear it - you can play it. So these drummers today, they are hearing me, they are hearing <Runo Bruno>, yes, I know the name of the young ledgins, you know Tony Royster, Tomas Pridgens all these drummers that are amazing - Gordon Campbel <???> - it's so many drummers - Nisan Store <???> - I can name them more, because they are all my friends And I love them and I can take from everything they drumming, it's som many. But because have youtube you have amazing sites drumeo and other sites, that you can get diffenerent things from.You are hearing all this. And if you can hear this -you can play it. So it is all about a progressing with it All about progressing with it.

00:20:36,897
00:00:06
N: So how do you get to that? How do you progress. What were the steps you took beside you just repetition with.

00:20:43,422

M: Totally..am.. totally everything you do - you got to start slow. It's just like a relationship like you just don't go to third base, you know, "hey girl, how do you doing let's go home", you know, it's kinda weird. Oh no. You know, you are be dealing with  websites <system> nowadays. Kinda crazy, you know. I raised in church we gotta go'em a long way. To get there you got to go a long way. But.. here you know everything takes time so like I'm just showing you, like that was a single, single phrase, single exercise, that was single exercise. And when you play the singles - you can accent on anyone that you want to don't take it if it as "I have to do it this way", okay? You re listening the music, so you can like "I love you, yeah, I love you, yeah".
