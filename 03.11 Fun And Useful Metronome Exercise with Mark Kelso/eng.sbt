1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,69
most people you know they use the
metronome as a haha i don't want to say

2
00:00:05,69 --> 00:00:11,759
a boat anchor but it's kind of what it
is if it's always on downbeats on one a

3
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:15,420
couple of things can happen it's it's a
can't function like a big boat anchor

4
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:20,520
and in that you can play to it but what
happens when you take that away and it's

5
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:24,210
it's not about you it's not in the gig
and you're playing with other guys do

6
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:28,439
you miss that sensation of it
controlling the time because it can take

7
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:33,540
over and you can sort of follow drummers
have to lead right they have to lead the

8
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:37,260
rhythm and lead and be powerful and get
their conviction and their control you

9
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:41,760
take that away have a week drummer then
nothing feel centered nothing feel

10
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,930
strong and people are are are
floundering on wells all over the place

11
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:52,500
so we have to be solid so i thought why
don't we take the metronome away and put

12
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:56,850
it on weaker beats so that we own the
downbeats so you know normally we're

13
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:16,170
always going to hear going here practice
this now I'd like to hear it is this the

14
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:21,000
most common thing in these exercises
people rush and the drop beats a because

15
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:27,60
they can't control their time and be
because they feel the tug of the acre

16
00:01:27,60 --> 00:01:30,570
the boat anchor pulling it back I would
you feel and come back we'll be right

17
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:34,798
back on the 21 again happens to my
students all the time like what happened

18
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:40,470
I said you dropped a sixteenth known i
did how it's just we're so trained to do

19
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:45,509
that so we're trying to open open the
mind to getting rid of that boat anchor

20
00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:55,20
so now i'll show you some experimenting
on the and getting in is always the

21
00:01:55,20 --> 00:01:58,20
hardest part but once you're in a lot of
fun

22
00:02:04,200 --> 00:03:09,930
yeah

23
00:03:10,819 --> 00:03:30,40
yeah

24
00:03:30,40 --> 00:03:43,540
yeah

25
00:03:44,530 --> 00:04:36,910
so instead of the new and click them
like this now

26
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:42,250
the concept is me and the clicker like
this and its rhythm works with my rhythm

27
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:47,770
and we go in conjunction to make a
really solid powerful rhythm together so

28
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:53,349
manna machine are working together to
create this powerful thing so it's not

29
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:57,700
mechanical its organic it feels good
it's strong as powerful so I started

30
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:03,490
thinking well what if i move it onto the
six teeth and this is where i got my

31
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:06,460
face slapped it's like that now i don't
think so

32
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:09,580
machines back in control thing and then
are you kidding me

33
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:14,530
this was hard so now I said the next
step for me was to master trying to get

34
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:19,90
on the fourth 16 yeah money money end up

35
00:05:20,849 --> 00:05:26,429
and II and-and-and-and-and

36
00:07:50,700 --> 00:08:39,240
yeah

37
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,780
ok
