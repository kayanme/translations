Hey guys, how's going.
00:00:19
00:00:21

I'm Aaron Edgar. I'm sitting here at Drumeo HQ in Abbot's <Third>.
00:00:22
00:00:24

And I've got a superfine concept for you guys today.
00:00:24
00:00:28

What we gonna do - is we're gonna take odd time beats and we're gonna make'em better.
00:00:28
00:00:34

Now, what I mean by that is we're gonna take a concept when we take 8th note beats like 5/8, 7/8,9/8.
00:00:35
00:00:44

It's doesn't working on things like 4/4 as it has to be an odd 8th note beat, but what we gonna do is we gone alternate from accenting and not accenting a riding surface.  
00:00:44
00:00:51

So we're just playing 8th notes at 7/8. 1,2,3,4,5,6,7. 1,2,3,4,5,6,7.
00:00:51
00:00:56

Instead of just accenting beat one of that, we can accent every other 8th note. 
00:00:56
00:01:01

Now the cool thing about this is we get to the second bar, it's gonna flip around to the other side of a beat. 
00:01:01
00:01:01

So.
00:01:01
00:01:10

We would have, for example, ONE-two-THREE-four-FIVE-six-SEVEN one-TWO-three-FOUR-five-SIX-seven. ONE.
00:01:10
00:01:20

So we have an alternating patterns gonna make our single bar 8th note beats take two bars to complete, because of this new sort of rhytmic layer that were adding on top of a beat.
00:01:20
00:01:28

Now you also don't need to start with the accent on the beat, you can start off the beat as well, but, before we get in the any of that, let's see, how is it gonna sound with the first beat.
00:01:28
00:01:31

The first beat we're gonna look at is at 5/8 time. 
00:01:31
00:01:35

Without anything fancy going on on a hihat, this is that that beat sounds just on it's on.
00:01:45
00:01:51

So that our 5/8 beat. Now before we gonna throw these accents let me show just the first bar is gonna sound like.
00:01:51
00:01:53

So this is with'em starting on the beat.
00:02:00
00:02:07

Now the second bar is gonna be the exact opposite to that. So we're gonna start with a hihat and accent on the second note, and a fourth note. 
00:02:14
00:02:17

Altogether,nice and slow, it sounds like this.
00:02:28
00:02:33

Alright. Now let's try this with a metronom, nice and slow, and a little bit quicker.
00:02:56
00:03:04

The next beat we're gonna look at is at 7/8 time. Let me just show the beat sounds like without anything fancy going on <accentlies>.
00:03:17
00:03:24

 Now for accents, because this basicaly sounds like 4/4 beat minus the last 8th note, those accents to gonna go where you naturally think they gonna go. 
00:03:24
00:03:28

On that first kick, on both of our snaredrums, and a kick right in there on a beat 3.
00:03:29
00:03:32

Lets' here just the first bar with the accents sounds like.
00:03:32
00:03:38

This time I'M gonna throw'em on a ride cymbal with the ride bell. So you can hear different variation on how we can use this concept.
00:03:49
00:04:01

Now for the second bar we're gotta go in between that on odd off-beats. SO it's gonna go on all the "ands" on one-and-two-and-three-and-four.
00:04:09
00:04:13

Now nice and slow lets put the two bars together.
00:04:26
00:04:33

Alright. Now let's put the metronom on try this nice and slow at 70 bpm and than a little quicker at a 100.
00:05:06
00:05:14

Alright. This is super fun to play, so let's get into one more 7/8 beat, cause this one of my favorite time signatures, but this time let's make it just more syncopating.
00:05:14
00:05:17

Let me show just the beat sounds like on it's own first.
00:05:34
00:05:37

This time, just to see what it sounds like, let's start with an off-beat variation.
00:05:37
00:05:48

So for our first bar we gonna go one-TWO-three-FOUR-five-SIX-seven, and than we're gonna start on the beat in the second bar with ONE-two-THREE-four-FIVE-six-SEVEN.
00:05:48
00:05:53

So just to show you guys a different variation I'm need to go between this stack and this closed set a hihat on my right hand.
00:05:53
00:05:59

Let's do it the whole thing sounds like nice and slow with the accents. Now remember we starting with the off-beat variation.
00:06:17
00:06:24

Now because we starting with the off-beat, throwing a crash on beat one in the pattern repeat sounds extra crook as it is come in between our accents.
00:06:24
00:06:27

Lets' start the metronome and try at 70 and a 100 beat per minute.
00:06:58
00:07:08

Alright I hope you guys has fun learning these beats there a ton of fun to play and a thing is most important to take away from this is that you can use this idea over any of your odd time 8th beats.
00:07:08
00:07:15

I strongly recommend you to try these over all your favorite 8th note beats and you can even try on bunch of different surfaces.
00:07:15
00:07:21

You don't have to stick between like a couple of a cymbal or anything. We can even do floor toms, for example, accenting on a 16 versus the 14. 
00:07:30
00:07:32

Anything and go from ride to china.
00:07:36
00:07:39

You seriously only limited by imagination.
00:07:39
00:07:48

I'm gonna play you a little bit more with advanced beats, using these concepts, but if you want to learn more of these types of ideas, you can sign up at the link right below this video for free 30 day trial at a Drumeo, 
00:07:49
00:07:52

where we teach tons of a crazy odd time beats and tons of fun little ideas like this.
00:07:53
00:07:55

Anyway,  until next time I see you guys inside the next video.
00:07:55
00:07:58

And I play some drums. See you guys.
