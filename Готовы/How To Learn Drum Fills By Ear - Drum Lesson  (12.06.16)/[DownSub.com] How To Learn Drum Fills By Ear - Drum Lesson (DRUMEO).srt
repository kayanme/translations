00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:09,220
hi everybody I'm Jimmy Rainsford i'm
here at Romeo and welcome to this

2
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:13,210
YouTube lesson where we're going to be
talking about how to learn drum fills by

3
00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:18,820
ear and now everyone wants to learn drum
fills drum fills all the fun part of

4
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:22,210
playing drums and yeah they're great

5
00:00:22,210 --> 00:00:25,750
and I want to just break down how you
would learn them by ear not writing them

6
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:30,250
down not using manuscript paper and just
listening to phil and really really

7
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:31,449
breaking it apart

8
00:00:31,449 --> 00:00:36,100
so I'm just going to play at a simple
fill a little a little bit on the

9
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:39,100
complicated side but we can break down
talk about so here we go

10
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:58,690
ok cool Phil quite simplistic and sounds
great around the kid he can move around

11
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:01,120
all the toms and let's break it down

12
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:04,449
ok let me just play the Phil again same
speed

13
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:15,780
ok the first thing you want to be
listening for is how long of the space

14
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:21,000
damn well actually take up for this Phil
it's taking up one full bars or one full

15
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,310
bar soul

16
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:29,520
ok that's the full length of the fill
and identify that first second thing you

17
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,890
got to identify is not wise

18
00:01:31,890 --> 00:01:35,580
what's going on the fill so if we count
a bar and we listened to the Phil it's

19
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:39,119
going to dinner

20
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:48,450
ok so let's just play that out so 123
for those notes one bar

21
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:52,259
let's move it to the snare ok so I'm
same again

22
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:59,549
if you're here to fill that I was doing
a few minutes ago it almost has that

23
00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:03,929
kind of feel it has like a did it did it
did it did it today

24
00:02:03,929 --> 00:02:08,549
ok and it's good to be able to sing the
phils that like it just even just sing

25
00:02:08,549 --> 00:02:14,190
them to yourself and get used to fill in
your head and i'm now for that certain

26
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:20,760
Phil it's good to kind of pick apart
which drum is where ok at where does the

27
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,78
snare fall

28
00:02:22,79 --> 00:02:27,000
where does each Tom get played you know
when exactly is the bass drum come in

29
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,359
you know you know the amount of notes in
the Phil now it's just about placing

30
00:02:30,359 --> 00:02:32,280
which drums are playing what

31
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:35,280
so we're not certain fill it has this
kind of rhythm

32
00:02:40,80 --> 00:02:43,650
ok the snare is still playing that back
beat on the fill

33
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:48,300
okay that's one thing you can identify
any any groove or in any fill as well as

34
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:53,250
the snare still playing the backbeat try
to fill and and as you heard i just

35
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:55,440
played with my hands I didn't use my
feet at all

36
00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:00,60
so let's now move on to what the phil
actually is with my feet

37
00:03:00,630 --> 00:03:04,230
listen out for weather scenarios like I
said that's enough for the Tom's for mr.

38
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:06,60
for room where the bass drum false

39
00:03:06,60 --> 00:03:10,770
so for that certain Phil let's try it
again this time I'm using my based on

40
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:22,769
ok ok

41
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:28,380
straightaway we've identified the fill
of identified idea the lengths to fill

42
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:30,209
we've identified amount of notes to fill

43
00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:34,770
now we've identified the orchestration
felt what drugs between and these little

44
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:37,500
tips can just make you break down a drum
fill a lot easier

45
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:41,190
don't don't listen to a drum fill and
think straight away oh it's this certain

46
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:41,640
way

47
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:45,750
really concentrate on it listen / -
again listen to where he's leading how

48
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:49,230
is leading back what symbol is going to
if you're watching the drummer player

49
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:52,738
look at what he's doing between his
hands and his feet you know some things

50
00:03:52,739 --> 00:03:56,910
can get very very complicated but most
of the time it's going to be the

51
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:59,579
simplest answer you know if you can if
you can do the simplest way and it still

52
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:00,510
sounds great
