let's take it a whole nother Direction K
let's take wanting to play fast but
00:01:29
00:01:33
let's bring it back down to where it got
you two playing fast
00:01:33
00:01:39
I remember coming up it was always a
simple things easy things like to over
00:01:39
00:01:43
two - this is what I call to over two, ok? cuz
it's just simple to explain ok -
00:01:43
00:01:47
That's playing two with my feet and two with
my hands that's me
00:01:47
00:01:51
that's how I explain it. Everybody has a
different way of explaining things in
00:01:51
00:01:54
talking just like when people talk and
be like yo what's up
00:01:55
00:01:58
you could be like yo what's up you can
say hello how are you doing today
00:01:58
00:02:01
it's very nice to see like yo how's it
hanging
00:02:01
00:02:04
if you like what is that it's all slang
so me
00:02:04
00:02:09
I called two up two down two up that's
to up with my hands to my feet that's
00:02:09
00:02:11

what's down so it's all the slang
00:02:11
00:02:15
it's all drones it's all love so let's
take this slow chap that I used to do
00:02:15
00:02:18

when I was a kid and let's speed it up.
00:02:18
00:02:21

you want to play fast i'm gonna show you
00:02:42
00:02:45
that chop was really slow likes to play
it as a kid all day
00:03:02
00:03:05
 that let's turn that
double chop into a fast shop let's add three notes with the hand
00:03:09
00:03:20
. More the hands
more notes
00:03:18
00:03:21

 if drums that in so many ways to build the speed
00:03:21
00:03:27
everything has to take time and develop
we even with speed
00:03:27
00:03:31
you've got to start out slow ok and then
make sure you cut on the metronome
00:03:31
00:03:36
for those of you that don't land on the
one it's so important to land on the one
00:03:36
00:03:40
in these chops if you don't land on the
one in the chopped and your chop does
00:03:41
00:03:46
will never count you have to hit the
one so remember when plague that we're
00:03:46
00:03:50
practicing and wanted to nail these
chops and wanting to be fast k you want
00:03:50
00:03:51

to be fast

you want to be fast you gotta push
yourself that means you gotta practice
00:03:55
