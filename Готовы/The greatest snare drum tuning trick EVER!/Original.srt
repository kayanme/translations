1
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:06,100
i'm going to show you and I'm so excited
about it

2
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:11,110
the greatest snare drum tuning trick
that I know on this planet if somebody

3
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:12,430
has a better trick

4
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:16,449
show it to me and i will use it but so
far that's the best trick

5
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:21,490
so let's start with the five points for
the snare drum tuning

6
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:27,550
so the first point is I'm going to crank
up the bottom head to death

7
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:34,270
really tabletop tight this means it's
mostly one and a half or up to two turns

8
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:42,250
and I start whether whether screws of
starting to grip so it will be like this

9
00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:43,750
one

10
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:46,750
one turn I like two turns on it

11
00:00:47,380 --> 00:01:00,250
basically you can count to four for half
turns one two three four 1234 1234

12
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:16,359
thank you four one two three four and
one two figure 4 forgot some yep

13
00:01:16,359 --> 00:01:22,810
one two three four and opposite side one
two three four

14
00:01:23,319 --> 00:01:26,319
so if you tap the head it sounds like

15
00:01:27,249 --> 00:01:33,670
so it's really high pressure and if the
bottom had has attention like this you

16
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:38,740
have the best snare wire response and
you can almost do whatever you want on

17
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:41,979
the top hat so let's swap the drum
around

18
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:57,600
ok so it gets now a bit

19
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:04,410
Einstein 'ish because it sounds
complicated what I'm doing now

20
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:10,679
but it is not you just have to get used
to it so i loosen all the screws and

21
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:26,160
step two is I'm gonna bring up all the
locks one turn it kind of varies on the

22
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:30,209
screws but you just have to check it out

23
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:37,740
what with what you start one and a half
time for one turn so let's bring this to

24
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:43,080
ok here's the point where started to
grip it's one go to the opposite side

25
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:46,560
fun yet yeah

26
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,560
one

27
00:02:50,970 --> 00:03:11,010
okay pups turn

28
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:23,310
so I just . starts and we already just
one this one this one is missing one

29
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:29,250
tutoring is to put here here is it and
one turn

30
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:35,010
so we've done everything one turn on
each luck

31
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:38,700
the drum now kind of sounds like this we
haven't done anything at all besides

32
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:44,820
keeping the resonant had tabletop tied
and making one turn on each lock on the

33
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,760
so you're i'm going to sound like this

34
00:03:54,350 --> 00:04:00,950
it's very high but we keep going

35
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:04,820
step three is now it gets a bit
complicated

36
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:17,030
you bring up the twelve o'clock screw a
whole turn then you bring up the 1

37
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:20,030
o'clocks through half of terms

38
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:30,850
and you want to bring up the
eleven-o'clock screw have returned as

39
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:42,880
ok so we don't care how the drum sounds
now and you always keep those three locks up here at this level you won't
touch them anymore

40
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:52,030
so the next thing is that we're going to
do drum sounds like this

41
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:59,770
we're going to news on the opposite side
of the hoop we're going to loosen the

42
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:06,070
what is it five o'clock screw one and a
half turn

43
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:11,950
you might say but a wait how can we
loosen it one and a half turn

44
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:14,980
if we only have one turn on the screw

45
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:19,570
we have more than one turn on the screen
now because we put a lot of pressure on

46
00:05:19,570 --> 00:05:25,210
this side and the hoop gets up on that
side so you have kind of more attention

47
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:28,510
on this one so take this one

48
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:35,140
one and a half turns out take the seven
o'clock screw one and a half turns out

49
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:40,180
which is mostly it's totally out the
only one turn

50
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:46,450
okay and make the six o'clock screw noce

51
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:57,810
so perhaps see there's a lot on it so
now you kind of feel here and you need

52
00:05:57,810 --> 00:06:02,729
to feel wrinkles if you don't feel any
wrinkles go on the five and six o'clock

53
00:06:02,729 --> 00:06:09,870
seven o'clock screw and loosen it even a
bit more so now we have the wrinkles in

54
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:12,720
here so all right here we go

55
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,680
the wrinkle was always something that
you don't want to have in the tom-toms

56
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:20,820
but we want to have it now in the snare
drum because our snare drum is now

57
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:40,139
sounding like this very dry and now we
still have four screws that we have not

58
00:06:41,729 --> 00:06:50,280
so the four screws on the side are
simply for your tone which means you go

59
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:56,820
up and down to match your desired note

60
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:12,310
so go around with it

61
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:35,410
ok so now we turn it down and the drum
sounds like it's totally dry

62
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:40,630
you don't have an overtone you can play
can get an even drier

63
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:51,430
it's it's like a muffled drum but it's
not actually muffled and with this

64
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:56,530
you still have all the high frequencies
on the drum head which is very important

65
00:07:56,530 --> 00:08:07,300
for the microphone and yeah we can play
now like ac/dc stuff and then you might

66
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:10,690
take a look at your set list and you
discover all my god

67
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:15,880
the next song is a fact song so what you
do is you just turn in the three screws

68
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:32,250
and there is your overtone so basically
you can completely control your overtone

69
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:35,669
just with three locks above

70
00:08:35,669 --> 00:08:58,860
so let's take it out and then you can
just simply dial in your desired amount

71
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:05,970
so no pre muffled drum heads required

72
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:10,710
I really no I never use pre Muffet it's
because those heads give me just one

73
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:17,280
sound of the drum and I just can only
use that sound but I can tune or detune

74
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:23,520
any overtones out of the skin and
everything you put on the skin killed

75
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:26,520
frequencies high frequencies

76
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:32,220
no matter to move in jail or as 0 ring
or whatever

77
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:38,640
I try to avoid this all the time because
that's my basic tuning trick and I have

78
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:48,990
full control over the whole snare drum
with this system and a fucking great

79
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:53,600
yes

80
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:57,319
yeah
