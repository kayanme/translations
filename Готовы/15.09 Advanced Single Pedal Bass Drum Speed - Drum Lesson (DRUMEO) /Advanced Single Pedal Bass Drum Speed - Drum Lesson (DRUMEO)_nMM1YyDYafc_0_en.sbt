hi I'm Jared ball and welcome to the
advanced lessons on how to adult single bass drum speed now
00:00:12
00:00:16
in this lesson we're going to be
experimenting with 32nd notes and
00:00:16
00:00:20
sixteenth note triplets and we're just
doing quick doubles
00:00:21
00:00:24

i'm using those different note values
00:00:24
00:00:28
alright so the first exercise basically
has two 32 note values
00:00:28
00:00:33
ah ok so if you count sixteenth notes
you go one-e-and ah
00:00:34
00:00:39
and that's where the 23 seconds start
because for each sixteenth note we have
00:00:39
00:00:44
23 seconds and so right before the start
of the next count
00:00:44
00:00:47
we're going to playing a quick double to
to pick up for that
00:00:47
00:00:51
ok so if you do want to count this you
want to go really really slow
00:00:51
00:00:54
let me just play it for you slow okay
and I'll and you can kind of hear
00:00:54
00:00:58
exactly how it should sound or how it
should be counted and counted on
00:00:58
00:01:03

k 1 e and a 2 e & 3 & 4 e
00:01:19
00:01:27
all right i'm playing these using the
heel toe technique you can choose a
00:01:30
00:01:36
it's completely up to but as far as the
32nd notes goes I don't really count
00:01:36
00:01:41
both 32nd notes there's no way that that
I've really developed to actually count
00:01:41
00:01:44
every single one just because it's
usually too fast and it's too much to
00:01:44
00:01:49
spit out at one time and so I usually
just counted with the sixteenth notes
00:01:49
00:01:49

like I told you
00:01:49
00:01:56
ok one-e-and ah ok you can go one E and
AH two-e and AH three E and out for it
00:01:56
00:01:58

if you want
00:01:58
00:02:02
you want to look really funny and stupid
like me so let's actually play that one
00:02:02
00:02:06
to tempo at 80 beats per minute and i'll
show you how it sounds when you
00:02:06
00:02:09

reference it to a click track
00:02:44
00:02:48
all right so you can imagine doing that
for you know five minutes a day
00:02:48
00:02:52
even just bad exercise for five minutes
today how much fast you'd be you'd be
00:02:53
00:02:58
the next exercise is the one that I
actually practice the most more than
00:03:03
00:03:07
I'm it's just a force of habit to play
this exercise but it's basically just
00:03:11
00:03:16
sixteenth note triplet partials in
between there so if you want to just
00:03:16
00:03:26
count it you can you can count one teat
ah or 1 T 2 and T 2 T 2 and T 3 - auntie
00:03:29
00:03:32
ok and you'll see that straight notes in
there
00:03:32
00:03:36

I don't really like saying teat ah right
00:03:36
00:03:39
like that so i usually don't count like
that I just kind of feel it and just
00:03:39
00:03:45
make sure that my hat right on the one
and two and three and four and
00:03:46
00:03:49
and then the basement strokes are
inserted in between there so you have groups of three
00:03:50
00:03:55
for every High had hit you play - based
from strokes and they're all even strokes
00:03:56
00:04:00
okay i'm gonna play that 70 beats per
minute show you guys exactly how it sounds
00:04:43
00:04:47
all right so that one doesn't get your
leg burning I don't know what we all ok
00:04:47
00:04:52
that one even for me it's still you know
starts to hurt in the the back my calf and even in the front
00:04:54
00:04:57
muscle a little bit not sure exactly
what it's called but that's the whole point right
00:04:58
00:05:02
get the burn going and then the next
time you load to play it faster and
00:05:02
00:05:05

longer just slowly progress that way
00:05:05
00:05:10
I'm the final exercise is basically just
going to be on the stairs on
00:05:10
00:05:14
ok play four notes on the snare drum two
notes on the kick drum to start and in
00:05:14
00:05:19
groups of 16 for triplets for the first
bar and then we switch 26 notes on the snare drum
00:05:20
00:05:23
- and the bass drum two groups of 32nd
notes 
00:05:23
00:05:26

ok so you're going to be especially when playing it faster tempo
00:05:26
00:05:29
it's hard to kind of differentiate
between the sixteenth note triplets and the 32nd notes
00:05:31
00:05:34
so it's a great exercise for that
especially when you're working out more
00:05:34
00:05:38
complex fills and I mean if you are
advanced or me you're watching this video you
00:05:38
00:05:42
you're probably starting to do some of
that stuff so it's important that the
00:05:42
00:05:47
timing on the quick double especially
going from 16 a triple 2 3 2nd note is
00:05:47
00:05:51
there because it's very very easy is but
I know for me it's very easy to kind of
00:05:51
00:05:55
blend them together you know and the the
sixteenth note triplet sounds exactly
00:05:55
00:06:00
the 32nd or the 32nd sounds exactly like
the sixteenth note triplet double
00:06:00
00:06:04
especially when played really really
fast because everything is just going
00:06:04
00:06:07
nuts and it's hard to kind of like
really break it down there
00:06:07
00:06:11
so let's start it at 70 beats per minute
and just really listen for the
00:06:11
00:06:13

difference in the note values
00:06:13
00:06:17
the tempo changes that we have to make
while playing this exercise as
00:06:17
00:06:21
alternates between six and triplets and
32nd notes and i want to say if you
00:06:21
00:06:24
don't have the sheet music Kate you can
just download it it should be below the
00:06:24
00:06:28
video if you're on drum lessons , if
you're not you gotta go find them or
00:06:28
00:06:32
enforce section of the video you'll find
a link to the website and find this
00:06:32
00:06:36
video and you can down the sheet music
for yourself okay you don't need a login stuff like that
00:06:37
00:06:40
let's go through this exercise 70 beats
per minute
00:06:46
00:07:29

yeah
00:07:35
00:07:41
alright so once you start experimenting
with that I just recommend you start
00:07:41
00:07:43
moving around the drums it's as simple
as that
00:07:43
00:07:46
and you guys can't take this to whatever
level you want to you know you can add
00:07:46
00:07:51
different groups that groups of one
around the drums and spreading at your
00:07:51
00:07:54
hands we actually you know working on
your feet
00:07:54
00:07:57
working on note values and then working
on moving around the kit k there's so
00:07:57
00:08:03
many different options for you hear that
said that's kind of the the end of our
00:08:03
00:08:06
single bass drum speed exercises ok you
know you had your beginner or
00:08:06
00:08:11
intermediate now you're on your advanced
and so there's a lifetime of work for you okay
00:08:12
00:08:17
I'm nowhere near where I want to be as
far as speed or control power on the
00:08:17
00:08:20
base - okay it's all a constant
progression i always want to get better
00:08:20
00:08:24
and i highly recommend that you always
want to -
00:08:24
00:08:27
