1
00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:08,920
time hi I'm John Faulkner welcome to the

2
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:12,400
intermediate lesson on how to build
single bass drum speed

3
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:16,330
LFS and the beginner lesson these
exercises can be applied

4
00:00:16,330 --> 00:00:20,090
I with both feet 10 so it's if your Dell
based on player

5
00:00:20,090 --> 00:00:23,619
you still need to practice the
techniques to control the speed

6
00:00:23,619 --> 00:00:27,180
with you right and your left foot if
you're single best umpire

7
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:33,329
is exercise we perfect fit K so in these
examples were gonna be focusing more on

8
00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:36,660
developing a quick double and then the
second exercise due notice for

9
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:41,730
quick triple and says a couple different
techniques you can use to do this

10
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:45,420
on the first to do a quick double as
using the Kyoto texting

11
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:49,489
now we have a video on from us is dot
com teaches that case of you wanna go ahead

12
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:53,129
and learn how to develop a quick double
you can do that

13
00:00:53,129 --> 00:00:57,340
If you just wanna win that's fine too that's how
I did it when I first started I just

14
00:00:57,340 --> 00:01:01,699
tried by Kurt Hummel and then the
technique I am involved itself

15
00:01:01,699 --> 00:01:05,129
I'm the other techniques you can use is
the slide technique

16
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:09,270
K Dave Atkinson has I'm video on dramas
and a common teachers

17
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:13,580
slight K as let's just jump into the
first exercise

18
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:17,509
and you know this is a groove I wouldn't
necessarily recommend playing for a

19
00:01:17,509 --> 00:01:18,330
whole song

20
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:22,280
or something like that so if you are
working on this exercise don't go your

21
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:25,640
band and start playing at the whole song

22
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:28,820
but it's something you could use as a as
a little Phil

23
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:33,090
or something like that but it is just an
exercise in so I just encourage you to use it

24
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:36,900
we are passing by itself but don't
necessarily

25
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:40,770
play for five minutes straight with the
fact that probably won't go over well

26
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:44,259
that said let's jump into the exercise
I'm

27
00:01:44,259 --> 00:01:47,560
it just gonna be to 16th notes on da

28
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:51,560
on and a beach P case 01 and that too

29
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:54,659
and out three and %uh for and i won

30
00:01:54,659 --> 00:02:00,390
and died too and 3 and ask for k andreas
ca start this release of her show have sounds

31
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:34,140
someone to show you guys how it sounded

32
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:38,180
play you know I 280 be thrilled to see
you can you know kinda see the end goal

33
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:43,310
you know what you can easily get 2k I
know you guys can easily do that

34
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:46,910
it's all about starting at the slow
temple and then working without

35
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:51,830
I also known as their when I was playing
the exercise at a beach minute I wasn't

36
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:54,500
really using any specific technique
other than

37
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:57,690
simply just heal up and plan the two
strokes

38
00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:01,320
K a lot of the techniques like the slide
Hill told they kinda have

39
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:05,320
a speed threshold where I'm you won't
necessarily use them

40
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:08,680
at at temples like a TV three-minute or

41
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:12,260
100 beats per minute session playing 60
pounds but your you know

42
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:16,090
with field so you kinda jump into it
around 110 and that's where it's

43
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:20,180
starts to be very very comfortable and
the timing of it works out perfectly for me.

44
00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:24,200
but before that are usually just play to
crypto strokes

45
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:28,500
out the next one is one actually gonna a
lot of questions about and that is

46
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,590
how do I quick triple struck and

47
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:35,370
there is basically to deploy singer one
is just using

48
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:38,510
your toe just play 3 quick notes

49
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:41,620
warning at to be can 3 an forty at

50
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:45,850
K and this exercise has been developed
to work on that case but like I said no

51
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:48,620
other one is it that says something a
play its role song

52
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:52,450
but you're gonna need to be able to do
three base from strokes in a row

53
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:56,660
so I thought why don't we work on it
here K that so that the first one is as

54
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:57,130
quick

55
00:03:57,130 --> 00:04:01,390
coaster the second anything to it is
using kinda I shields' whole

56
00:04:01,959 --> 00:04:05,140
hybrid thing I call it which which job
is basically

57
00:04:05,739 --> 00:04:09,209
you know you hit one stroke when you
drop your foot

58
00:04:09,209 --> 00:04:12,350
and then you hit two more on the way up

59
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:16,400
K something to show you guys this
exactly how it looks

60
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,660
and others will show you the full can
see 6s helps

61
00:04:46,773 --> 00:04:47,940
OKC guys gonna

62
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:50,940
to figure out what works good for you
you know no one

63
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:54,250
really when I was starting I know we
didn't have this kind of technology were i can

64
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:58,300
I had a teacher that was dismissed
hotline I'm

65
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:01,669
so I had known the show with me really
other than my private teacher who

66
00:05:01,669 --> 00:05:04,940
we've there's no way to know if he
actually knows are not and I didn't know necessary to ask for

67
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:10,990
I'm so it's all about you know work
figure out what works best for you and

68
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:12,760
kinda involving that technique

69
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:16,039
you know there's so many different
genres and every single driver has

70
00:05:16,039 --> 00:05:19,510
little variations that are different in
the techniques that they use

71
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:22,950
so I'm says hi recommend just a watch
other drivers

72
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:26,470
what are they doing to do a picture of a
stroke and figure out what works best for you

73
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:30,979
and then definitely practice at uses
exercise because

74
00:05:30,979 --> 00:05:35,180
you need to develop some speed some
control to do a quick triple

75
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:40,280
with the single pedal test let's do the
exercise the first wanna do it seventy

76
00:05:40,280 --> 00:06:12,460
beats per minute d

77
00:06:14,610 --> 00:06:17,690
so the quick triple as something I'm
definitely working on and I'm actually

78
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:18,770
going between 2n

79
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:22,870
but he'll told variation and then just
80 variation and just try to stay out

80
00:06:22,870 --> 00:06:25,910
you know what's the most consistent
sometimes I find I do

81
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:29,300
the hotel a variation of it I get a
strong first row

82
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:32,620
a week middle and a strong and stroke so

83
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:36,660
like I said before is all about their
works best for you and practice practice

84
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:37,300
practice

85
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:40,770
practice that said let something that's
one

86
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:44,410
this morass is going to start moving
around the drums and I absolutely love playing

87
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:48,830
this hasher size and it's a great one
too number one

88
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:52,430
practice your single bass drum pedal
speed and them into

89
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:55,360
practice working on the drums and the
way ever written is just too unless

90
00:06:56,010 --> 00:06:59,670
to Anaheim Tom to on the men Tom to in
the low Tom

91
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:03,950
out with the double in between each one
does but eventually

92
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:07,320
you can get a point where you just
playing around whatever

93
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:10,880
K so that sent let's jump in this on at
her beats per minute

94
00:07:38,839 --> 00:07:40,340
the alright guys remember it's not

95
00:07:40,340 --> 00:07:44,630
race case not about beatings the last
person to the next hour

96
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:48,060
the scene is faster it's not about that
it's just about to volcanic

97
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:53,200
control I'm said about the speed that
you need to play the style of music

98
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:56,470
you're actually want to play okay and
suggests

99
00:07:56,470 --> 00:08:00,880
work on what you need to do I'm for the
band or the music you're playing with a

100
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:03,210
highly recommend you do that and

101
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:06,650
are seeing guys in the advanced video
we're going to talk about some

102
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:09,670
different concepts to develop single
based on speed

103
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:12,670
a senior this
