Hey guys, this is Ash Pirson from Revocation, and I'm here at Drumeo HQ to talk to you today about some of my warmup routine before I play.
00:00:45
00:01:12

So, on tour in Revocation, we're playing long sets anywhere from half an hour to an hour each night and playing at anywhere from like 160 to 230 bpm throught out the night, so it's a lot of work, that goes into just one performance and to help me achieve that I'm doing all sorts of thing through my day to help prepare.
00:01:13
00:01:24

You know, some - some gigs are magic and you can't always do everything that will be <full proof ways> that let you perform like a god each night. We are all human.
00:01:25
00:01:29

But these are some thing that you can do to increase your chances to play a better show.
00:01:29
00:01:45

So, what I like to do my warmup usually starts more or less at the begininng of a day, honestly I just gonna take you through a day of me on tour, 'cause it all centered around performing at the end of a night you know that the job that you are there to do.
00:01:47
00:02:03

So. I wake up and I slam a bunch of water, so I start with that. Water is a big part of a day, you know, I mean to be dehydrating and stuff like that to me is pretty important, you know, some people have different consitutions and they can get away with just slam a coffee and booze all day, but I just, I just can't do it
00:02:03
00:02:12

So, I slam some water, try to eat a good light breakfast or something like that, because you are also usually sitting in a van when you're going from place to place as well.
00:02:12
00:02:17

So, I'd advise not  eat too much fastfood because you eat it and you just seat there in a van.
00:02:18
00:02:31

Em, m, maybe open up a drumbook or something like that and through a few things like on my hands, you know, in the van. Am. You know, compound time signatures or maybe messing around with the practice patterns something like that.
00:02:31
00:02:48

I definitly notice, that the days I was warming up a little bit before the show I end up playing better at night time. You know if I was like just playing lightly in the afternoon and so all, I do thing like, you know, just like rudiments, singles, doubles, paradiddles and stuff like that.
00:02:48
00:03:00

Or I'll trying learn something new. But, I get to the gig, you know, maybe we go on a soundcheck, maybe we won't, I'll take here up to sort maybe a few hours before we actually go on stage and play.
00:03:00
00:03:22

So, I'll eat dinner, and then after dinner I maybe go for a walk a little bit, because if you walk or run that's a benefit to playing an athletic set, you know, you think of this may tire you up if you go for a run earlier or the day, I'm guarantee you're lung capacity is going to be increased.It's, it's a benefit for you, if you gonna play a long set at night.
00:03:23
00:03:38

But after I eat, you know, I maybe go for a long walk, half an hour or something like that, to, you know, help you digesting and you get, you get some breath going through you, some blood pumping. It's, it's part of a real warmup as far as I see, you know, you are light, you lightly using your legs, so you warming up your legs a bit.
00:03:38
00:03:46

Em, and then maybe er, I like to take a short napper something like that to like recharge my baterries.
00:03:46
00:04:04

So, when it comes time to get close to playing, I'll stop drinking coffee bef, like, two hours before I play 'cause I don't want my, I won't be able to play from my muscles, a musscle memory, I don't want my nerves to be on edge and, you know, it tend to make more mistakes that way if you are little bit more on edge and nervous.
00:04:05
00:04:10

So, I'll abstain from coffee, I'll be drinking some water, maybe some vitamins or something like that.
00:04:11
00:04:18

Sometimes I'll make leg ashake, like an hour and a half before I go on and get a bit of a vitamin <potassium booster?> or something like that.
00:04:18
00:04:24

I find all those things help, drinking lots of water and stuff like that. So I will be doing that all up to when it comes time to actually go on stage.
00:04:24
00:04:32

But in terms of an actual warmup part of my routine, I'll start wearing these babies, ankle weights.
00:04:33
00:04:53

Part of my routine, you know, just from on and walk around a little bit with them. Not too much, because you can start hearts your knees after a long while of wearing'em, but I wear them for, when I'm sitting behind a practice pad and stuff, because you don't always you don't get along upon a drum set always when are on tour, so.
00:04:53
00:05:02

Practice pad it is, you know sometimes you get a foot pedal practice pad, which is great, you know, you can use those, but I just like to wear these ankle weights and just call it a day.
00:05:03
00:05:04

And I take'em off before I go on stage.
00:05:05
00:05:08

I learned that trick from, em, Gene Hogland, one of the best.
00:05:08
00:05:09

So,
00:05:11
00:05:24

Let just, you know, don't try to learn anything new, when you're warming up, you know, you don't wanna be messing around the crazy independece exercise when you trying just get reacquanted with what it's like to play singles and doubles, and paradiddles and stuff like that.
00:05:24
00:05:39

What I like to do is get back to the very baseline of what it truly means to have maximum influence with minimum input, so I will get a baseline for what minimum input is, and that is this. For me.
00:05:39
00:05:46

This, I find this to be quite beneficial, I just, like even lower than a ghost note, I just lift it a little bit and I let it drop.
00:05:47
00:05:50

And trying to get some good bounces out of them.
00:05:51
00:05:59

Because in that I'm seeing the, the most baseline of a better force that need to put my hand in order to make that stick move.
00:05:59
00:06:03

So once I''m reacquanted with that, than I start to bounce it a little bit higher.
00:06:04
00:06:07

Boom, I'm just bouncing'em, I'm just throwing'em down and not pulling them up.
00:06:08
00:06:14

And this is that I'll start with and I start with each hand this way, so I just do some fall strokes, some free strokes.
00:06:15
00:06:18

Free strokes where you just throwing it down and you catch them as they comes back up.
00:06:18
00:06:23

So, fall strokes, like that. I do the same exact same thing with the left.
00:06:23
00:06:27

Right,Bounce it, bounce it.
00:06:28
00:06:34

And then do it, at eight on each hand. 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8, 1-2-3-4-5...
00:06:35
00:06:37

Than, singles, alternating.
00:06:39
00:06:43

Doubles, I'll get reacquanted what is like to play a proper double.
00:06:45
00:06:48

I'll do that first. Before I jumping to a new exercise.
00:06:48
00:06:58

And I'm also not doing this too fast, by the way, I'm playing it at sort of a moderate tempo, because it called a "warmup", it's not called "jumping into the boiling water" exercise, you know.
00:06:59
00:07:02

You don't wanna start off that way, or you gonna seize your muscles a bit.
00:07:02
00:07:12

Your muscles are like an elasitic band, you know, it's gonna be able to stretch further if it's warm, if it's cold and you trying to stretch, then it's gonna snap in the case of a rubber band, so.
00:07:12
00:07:15

1-2,1-2,1-2,1-2.
00:07:20
00:07:21

Play doubles.
00:07:22
00:07:24

And then I move on to paradiddles.
00:07:28
00:07:29

Double paradiddles.
00:07:30
00:07:31

Triple paradiddles.
00:07:34
00:07:35

May some flams.
00:07:45
00:07:49

Just get your hands reacquanted with what it's like to play those kinds of things.Drags.
00:07:56
00:08:00

So, you warm up your hands. Get'em used to playing again.
00:08:00
00:08:06

Eh, it's not like that you forgot, but just one of those things you need. Get'em a little bit  reminder, get reacquanted with.
00:08:06
00:08:25

And, I'll also do an independence exercise. But something, that I actually learned prior to this - I'm not gonna sit down and trying figure out an independence exercises part of my warmup routine, I'll do something like a bossa-nova or something like that on the feet, and just play some different patterns on toms.
00:00:38
00:09:07

Those sort of things just get my diffenerent sides of my brain kind of working together, so when it comes time to go up there and play, you know, I got my limbs are utilized and aligned, you know, independence and coordination.
00:09:07
00:09:11

So try not to loose up that aspect of your warmup.
00:09:11
00:09:19

And then finally, once I start to get faster, I'll just play for like a longer periods of time. I'm just bouncing and just making sure that I feel like I can do this all day.
00:09:21
00:09:30

I'm dont wanna play so fast for so long that I burn myself up before the show and anything like that, but just get your muscles used to doing this kind of work.
00:09:33
00:09:33

One last note on the feet.
00:09:36
00:09:46

If you don't have a kick pedal practice pad to warm up with, I find the most effective thing is to put your ankles flat on the ground like so, and just to a little lifts up like this.
00:09:47
00:09:53

Little drive lifts and just do a contraction and maybe just do like fifty on each foot or something like that.
00:09:54
00:10:05

So, you're just going up and down and you're squeezing and releasing the shin muscle which you don't use as much as your calf, because you're alwayse pushing off with your calf as you walk,
00:10:05
00:10:08

so are lot more used to using that muscle, so.
00:10:08
00:10:15

So, if you warm up the front one, then wanna comes time to do longer phrases all that extra work.
00:10:17
00:10:27

If your calf start to burn out a bit, you're front is already warmed up and it's naturally gonna help you break up that work between both of those muscle groups, so.
00:10:27
00:10:36

This is a wise thing to warmup, and it doesn't take much more than just doing this. A little bit and giving it, you know, shaking and stuff like that.
00:10:36
00:10:45

And again, slam some more water, maybe some vitamins,I also like to close my eyes for a few minutes before I go on stage and just kind of few of my body's <outified?> from tense, of nervouse anywhere.
00:10:45
00:10:56

I just trying make sure that my breath is aligned with, with my mind, so I don't get too nervous, and I don't do any slip-ups, and than you should be ready go out there and kill that gig.
00:10:56
00:11:01

So there it is. I hope that gives you some insight into my routine that I have, when I'm on the road.
00:11:01
00:11:09

Starts, it starts when I wake up, and it finishes when I go to sleep, so really I'm just living and breathing drums, and thinking about it all the time.
00:11:09
00:11:19
