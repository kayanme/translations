1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,840
yeah

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:09,860
hi guys I'm Jade fault and in today's
lesson we're going to talk about

3
00:00:09,860 --> 00:00:12,860
developing speed using a single bass
drum pedal

4
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:17,359
now if you are double pedal player you
can still use these exercises to develop

5
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:21,170
speed with each foot individually ok so
you can practice with your right foot

6
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:24,110
and then also practice them with your
left foot

7
00:00:24,110 --> 00:00:27,830
these are some exercises i developed I'm
calling the beginning exercises but

8
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:31,400
obviously it's all about the kind of a
temple you play than that so if you want

9
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,410
to play them really really fast

10
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:37,790
that would obviously be more of an
advanced speed stuff like that but

11
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:41,090
Before we jump into that wanted to talk
a little bit about just the techniques

12
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:46,969
that you're using now you'll notice I'm
using what what Sean lang calls the flat

13
00:00:46,969 --> 00:00:51,440
foot technique and that's where my foot
is just my the heel of the foot is

14
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:55,070
slightly off the pedal and when I
actually go fast i'm using this technique

15
00:00:55,969 --> 00:01:02,449
ok if you want you can bring your your
foot on top of the pedal

16
00:01:02,449 --> 00:01:06,289
however when going fast and stuff like
that is I find if I move my foot

17
00:01:06,289 --> 00:01:11,450
you know just halfway down the pedal I'm
able to get faster and it will be easier

18
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:14,959
and i'll be able to play those strokes
for longer and so that's why I'm doing

19
00:01:14,959 --> 00:01:18,229
that you'll also notice I'm not using
heel down

20
00:01:18,229 --> 00:01:23,149
ok I want to get a little bit more
powerful of stroke so i'm using that

21
00:01:23,149 --> 00:01:27,109
heal up flat foot technique if you want
to practice with heel down there is

22
00:01:27,109 --> 00:01:28,729
absolutely nothing wrong with that

23
00:01:28,729 --> 00:01:31,579
I know there is a lot of heel down
drummers that that's what they play that

24
00:01:31,579 --> 00:01:35,869
exclusively and that's totally fine i'm
not one to tell you what technique there

25
00:01:35,869 --> 00:01:39,469
is right or what technique is wrong ok
with whatever works for you and music

26
00:01:39,469 --> 00:01:43,340
you play but I'm really playing these
exercise all at two different temples

27
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:47,899
ok a slow and a fast time because i
really just want you guys to to hear how

28
00:01:47,899 --> 00:01:50,509
they sound when you're first starting
out so if you're if you are beginning

29
00:01:50,509 --> 00:01:53,239
you know you should play it very very
slow especially you're first starting

30
00:01:53,239 --> 00:01:56,599
out but then there's always like you
always want to push it because we're

31
00:01:56,599 --> 00:02:01,759
trying to develop Spieth right but speed
doesn't come with without control so we

32
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:05,209
still want to make sure we have control
and that's why we start slow and then

33
00:02:05,209 --> 00:02:06,919
speed it up aggressively

34
00:02:06,919 --> 00:02:10,670
so with that said let's jump in to
exercise number 1 i'm going to be

35
00:02:10,670 --> 00:02:13,670
playing this at 70 beats per minute

36
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:49,070
alright so that's just a very basic
exercise to help you guys develop the

37
00:02:49,070 --> 00:02:52,880
control and then you can continually
speed it up and I only max out there at

38
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:57,350
120 but obviously I would continue to
push it push it and and hopefully get to

39
00:02:57,350 --> 00:03:02,900
around 180 190 200 somewhere in there
and then I'd also practice that with my

40
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:06,830
left foot especially if you want to do
some fast singles or whatever you know

41
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:11,900
you're only as fast as your slowest foot
and so it's important to work on both feet.

42
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:16,400
the next exercise we're going to do it
just incorporate some sixteenth notes in there

43
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:20,210
ok we're going to start this at 70 beats
per minute and the group of sixteenth

44
00:03:20,210 --> 00:03:23,990
notes is on count for so make sure you
guys get the sheet music for this case

45
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:26,960
you're watching this on the drum lessons
dr. website it's right below you'll find

46
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:33,440
it in that the PDF link if you're
watching someone else just go onto the

47
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:46,180
yeah

48
00:03:46,180 --> 00:04:09,549
ok so what that exercise is going to
help you with is doing those short bursts

49
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:13,870
you know where you need a quick three
strokes or a quick two strokes or

50
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:17,470
whatever it is going to help you develop
the techniques and the control to

51
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:23,919
the next exercise is basically to
incorporate more of those 16 notes so we

52
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:28,240
just have two eighth notes and then a
group of 16 notes 28 notes and a group of 16

53
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:32,470
ok so let's try this one at 70 beats per
minute

54
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:51,949
yeah

55
00:04:53,289 --> 00:05:08,050
alright guys so getting fast with a
single pedal

56
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:12,550
there's not really any quick fix or
anything that's gonna you know

57
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:17,740
increase the speed of this within 10
minutes or stuff like that k

58
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:20,499
there are certain techniques need to
learn to do a quick doubles and stuff

59
00:05:20,499 --> 00:05:25,300
like that but to play consistent and
constant notes the best and easiest way

60
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:29,409
to do it is to just practice these
exercises and started a temperature

61
00:05:29,409 --> 00:05:32,559
comfortable with and then slowly
progress faster and you're going to

62
00:05:32,559 --> 00:05:36,339
playing drums your whole life so don't
worry if you have to you know really

63
00:05:36,339 --> 00:05:40,300
focus on bass drum technique for 12
months or 24 months or something like that

64
00:05:40,809 --> 00:05:44,110
there's absolutely nothing wrong with
that and the more control you develop

65
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:48,520
the easier it will be to go fast so I
just highly recommend start slow and

66
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,889
then slowly progress faster

67
00:05:50,889 --> 00:05:53,919
so once you're done this beginner lesson
you can move on to the intermediate

68
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:57,459
lesson on how to build single bass drum
speed i'll see you guys there
