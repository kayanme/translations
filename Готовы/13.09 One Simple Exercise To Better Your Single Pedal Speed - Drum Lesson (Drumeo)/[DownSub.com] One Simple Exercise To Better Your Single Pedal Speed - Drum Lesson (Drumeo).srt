00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,429
hello everybody my name is eric Moore
and I am very very pleased to be here

2
00:00:11,429 --> 00:00:15,990
you all want to give you guys a great
exercise that's going to build your foot

3
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:18,480
speed like everybody always asks me Eric

4
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,810
how do you get your foot to move so fast
how do you get to play what you play

5
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:25,979
well a lot of things I used to do
especially now that I'm older playing

6
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:30,480
different styles of music and rock music
i like to use this certain exercise so

7
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,880
I'm gonna give you guys an example

8
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,170
I like to start out with the metronome
so if you have a metronome

9
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,860
you can send it out whatever temple that
works best for you

10
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:44,730
okay you've got to start at your own
speed whatever is best for you i'm going

11
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:47,730
to start out at 65 BPM

12
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:51,420
here's the exercise

13
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:28,720
what I really notice about this exercise
for one

14
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:39,250
you're really really keeping a strong
steady pace with your foot that that's

15
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:43,450
giving you a double in the beginning and
it's not a triple but it's three notes

16
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:48,670
so three consisting mostly with a nice
space

17
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:52,240
so even when you're playing other beasts

18
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:05,530
you can play the different rhythms

19
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:09,910
but this one foot exercise is going to
build that calf muscle that you need in

20
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:13,690
order to get your foot to do what you
have to do everything takes practice

21
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:16,720
so you have to start slow and you gotta
start from somewhere

22
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:21,430
also for those of you i'm just taking
this out for some of you that don't play

23
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:24,910
with your heel up how some people play
with their foot down

24
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:27,910
so let's try it with the hill down also

25
00:02:56,20 --> 00:03:03,520
now i'm going to speed it up

26
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:41,109
let's take it up from 65 to 75 BPM take
it up even faster

27
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:45,940
all healed up

28
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:11,980
5b pm's i'm going to go up to 95 PPM's

29
00:04:28,849 --> 00:04:48,349
pick it up even faster

30
00:04:49,39 --> 00:04:52,399
I'm telling you the more you do this
exercise the more your foot will start

31
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:53,509
to burn baby

32
00:04:53,509 --> 00:04:56,509
got to get that burn going

33
00:04:57,20 --> 00:05:00,20
105

34
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:38,840
I'm so i'm pretty sure it's starting to
kick in now and having a little

35
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:41,750
difficulty hard to keep that temple
going

36
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:45,920
but hey this is how you get better man
you got to keep on pushing yourself

37
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:48,920
I'm gonna take it up to 115 k

38
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:09,830
yeah

39
00:06:11,30 --> 00:06:14,989
so let me give you an example of how
playing this and using this at this

40
00:06:14,990 --> 00:06:18,200
temple will definitely get your foot to
move faster

41
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:21,530
that'll get your doubles working your
trip was going and you could incorporate

42
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:25,789
this in all different styles of your
music just a great foot exercise k

43
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:29,630
